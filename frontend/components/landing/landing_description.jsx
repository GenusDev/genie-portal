      <p>Welcome to the Genie Portal, a prototype for what Progeny hopes to create for small to medium size real estate developers everywhere!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With the aid of blockchain smart contracts, Progeny transforms your real estate into a unique security token. Tokens are sold through developer-specific portals, which feature analytical dashboards for managing and marketing investments. The genie portal features a mock version of one such portal. All projects and purchases presented herein are for demonstration purposes only and as such operate via a mock ethereum blockchain with mock ether.
      <br/>
